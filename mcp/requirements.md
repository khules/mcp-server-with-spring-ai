### **ðŸ“‹ Functional Requirements**

#### **User Management**
* **User Profiles:** Users can create and manage accounts with personal details, profile pictures, and vehicle information.
* **Roles:** The system supports two primary user types: **Drivers** and **Passengers**.
* **Authentication:** Users can register using email/password or third-party social logins (e.g., Google, Facebook).

#### **Trip Management**
* **Trip Creation:** Drivers can post trips, specifying the origin, destination, time, and available seats.
* **Search & Booking:** Passengers can search for and request to join trips based on their route and schedule.
* **Trip Status:** A clear workflow for trip status, including pending, confirmed, in-progress, and completed.
* **History:** Users can view their past and upcoming trips.

#### **Subscriptions & Payments**
* **Subscription Plans:** Offer various subscription tiers (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annual).
* **Payment Integration:** Securely process payments for subscriptions via a reliable payment gateway like **Stripe** or **PayPal**.
* **Billing Dashboard:** Users can track their payment history and manage their subscription status.

#### **Communication & Feedback**
* **In-App Messaging:** Enable direct communication between drivers and passengers.
* **Notifications:** Send push notifications, SMS, or email alerts for important updates (e.g., trip confirmations).
* **Ratings & Reviews:** Implement a two-way rating and review system to build trust and accountability within the community.

### **ðŸ’» Technical Requirements**

#### **Backend**
* **Language & Framework:** A modern, scalable stack like **Python (Django)**, **Node.js (Express)**, or **Java (Spring Boot)**.
* **Database:** A robust and scalable database, such as **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**, to handle user, trip, and payment data.
* **API:** A **RESTful** or **GraphQL API** to power the frontend applications.
* **Authentication:** **OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect** for secure authentication. The system will integrate with an external **Keycloak** server for token management.
* **Authorization:** Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to manage permissions for Drivers and Passengers.

#### **Frontend**
* **Mobile App:** A cross-platform solution using **React Native** or **Flutter** to support both iOS and Android.
* **Web App:** A responsive web application built with a modern framework like **React**, **Angular**, or **Vue.js**.

#### **Infrastructure & DevOps**
* **Cloud Hosting:** Deploy the application on a reliable cloud provider (**AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Microsoft Azure**).
* **CI/CD:** Use an automated pipeline for continuous integration and continuous deployment.
* **Monitoring:** Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging to ensure application health and performance.

#### **Third-Party Integrations**
* **Maps & Geolocation:** Integrate with a mapping service like **Google Maps API** or **Mapbox** for real-time location tracking and route planning.
* **Payment Gateway:** Integrate with **Stripe** or **PayPal** for payment processing.
* **Notifications:** Use a service like **Twilio** (for SMS) or **SendGrid** (for email) for communication alerts.

#### **Security**
* **Data Encryption:** Encrypt all sensitive user data both in transit (using **HTTPS/TLS**) and at rest.
* **Payment Security:** Adhere to **PCI DSS** standards for handling payment information.
* **API Security:** Implement measures like rate limiting, API key management, and input validation to protect against common vulnerabilities.
